and improve search engine optimization (SEO) know what the main content of your site is.

2. Name two big differences between display: block; and display: inline;.
The two significant differences between block and inline elements are those block elements 
will always start a new line on the page. In contrast, inline will have elements next to other 
inline elements. Another difference is that inline elements can usually only contain other inline 
elements and data, which block elements can include both. Display:block and display:inline can 
adjust how an element is displayed on the page.
